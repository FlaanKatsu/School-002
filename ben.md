* 豊原市のВладимировкаはЮжно-Сахалинскです。 (this makes no sense and is arguably gramatically incorect)
* russian convicts founded a settlement on some random island, and called it Владимировка (vladimirovka)
* russia transfered ownership of the southern half of this island to 大日本天国　japan
* the southern half of the island was named the karafuto prefecture
* japan decided to develop the settlement into a town(the capital of the karafuto prefecture), renamed the town 豊原市(toyohara-shi)
* in world war 2 the soviet union stole the south half of the island back
* the CCCP renamed the town Южно-Сахалинск (yuzhno sahalinsk)
